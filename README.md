# DND
Creates a text-based DnD game through Bash scripting. The story will be updated over time to add more story.

- Will include a slightly simplified class system as opposed to the 5e rules at the start of implementation, but will later be updated to match the 5e classes better
- Levels will go 1-5 at the first iteration due to limited story. Later will be updated to 1-10, then 1-20. "DLC" versions will also be pushed for those that want to continue their journey along the way of updates. 


Known Issues:
- Sometimes when allocating points, the logic does not work properly, I plan to fix this tomorrow on 2/28/2025
