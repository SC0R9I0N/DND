# DND
Creates a text-based DnD game through Bash scripting. The story will be updated over time to add more story.

- Will include a slightly simplified class system as opposed to the 5e rules at the start of implementation, but will later be updated to match the 5e classes better
- Levels will go 1-5 at the first iteration due to limited story. Later will be updated to 1-10, then 1-20. "DLC" versions will also be pushed for those that want to continue their journey along the way of updates. 
- I apologize in advance for the current lack of comments in the script. More comments will be added as the implementation grows, I wanted to just get something down that worked before going ham on 3 million comments

Known Issues:
- None at the moment, but currently cuts off after selecting Proficiencies, or weapon selection if you choose a Barbarian.

Update (3/5/25)
- I started implementing a case-based weapon/spell/cantrip. For the moment, I've only implemented a weapon selection for the Barbarian class. Upcoming updates will first go through the basic melee/ranged characters, ending with Paladins. After which, I will then move on to spellcasters. IMPORTANT NOTE: Spellcasters will have only a select number of cantrips and spells at their disposal as it is completely unreasonable for me to include every single possible spell/cantrip/weapon/shield in 5e. More to come
